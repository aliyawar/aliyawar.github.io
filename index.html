  <p>I am a Post-doctoral researcher in the Skeletal Biology and Biomechanics Lab, and lecturer in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard. I got my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the <a href="http://mvlab.yale.edu">Biomechanics and Control Lab</a> at Yale University. I work on the biomechanics of the human foot, specifically, the contribution of the arches of the foot to its stiffness, and how muscles modulate it during locomotion. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Roorkee (B.Tech. 2014). In the past, I have worked at the Collective Interactions Unit at OIST, Japan (2015), the Learning Algorithms and Systems Lab at EPFL (2014), Switzerland, the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, Germany (2013) and NCBS-TIFR, India (2012).</p>
