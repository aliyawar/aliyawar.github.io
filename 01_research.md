My PhD research focuses on the structural principles that underlie human foot function. Specifically, what makes the foot stiff? 

---
# Curvature of the transverse arch of the foot
When we run, our feet withstand loads that are many times our bodyweight. Our stiff feet enable us to impulsively push off on the ground. What imparts our feet with this high stiffness?

Part of the contribution comes from tissues that span the length of the foot, forming a bow-string arrangement with the longitudinal arch of the foot. We ask if the other, transverse arch of the foot plays a role in stiffening. 

Through a combination of mathematical modeling, physical experiments and cadaveric load testing, we identify the role of the transverse arch of the foot. Its role can be understood through an analogy with an everyday observation. When you hold a dollar bill from one end (or a slize of pizza), it is floppy and cannot even hold its own weight. Curling it in the transverse direction dramatically stiffens it. Transverse curavture couples bending of the bill with stretching in-plane.

We hypothesize that a similar mechanism stiffens the human foot.

We find that the same parameter explains the stiffness of a foot mimic

The following video demonstrates the effect of cutting inter-metatarsal tissues using a foot mimic.
