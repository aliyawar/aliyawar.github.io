I am a Post-doctoral researcher in the Skeletal Biology and Biomechanics Lab, and lecturer in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard. I got my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the [Biomechanics and Control Lab](http://mvlab.yale.edu) at Yale University. I work on the biomechanics of the human foot, specifically, the contribution of the arches of the foot to its stiffness, and how muscles modulate it during locomotion. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Roorkee (B.Tech. 2014). In the past, I have worked at the [Nonlinear and Non-equilibrium Physics Unit](https://www.oist.jp/groups/collective-interactions-unit-mahesh-bandi?page=1) at OIST, Japan (2015), the [Learning Algorithms and Systems Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasa/) at EPFL (2014), Switzerland, the [Institute for Control Systems](https://www.tuhh.de/ics/welcome.html) at TUHH, Germany (2013) and NCBS-TIFR, India (2012).
