I am a post-doctoral scientist at Amazon Robotics. My interestes are in designing and building wearable sensors, and human-robot interaction. Previously, I was a postdoc at Harvard working with [Dan Lieberman](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/skeleton/home). I was also a lecturer there in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology where I taught courses on the physics and engineering of wearable sensors. I got my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the [Biomechanics and Control Lab](http://mvlab.yale.edu) at Yale University where I worked on the [mechanics of human feet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2053-y). I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Roorkee (B.Tech. 2014). In the past, I have worked at the [Nonlinear and Non-equilibrium Physics Unit](https://www.oist.jp/groups/collective-interactions-unit-mahesh-bandi?page=1) at OIST, Japan (2015), the [Learning Algorithms and Systems Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasa/) at EPFL (2014), Switzerland, the [Institute for Control Systems](https://www.tuhh.de/ics/welcome.html) at TUHH, Germany (2013) and NCBS-TIFR, India (2012).
