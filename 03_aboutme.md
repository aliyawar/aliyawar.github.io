I was born and brought up in [Udaipur, Rajasthan, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udaipur). If you ever visit India, there is a high probability that you will go to Udaipur. As you should! Someday, when I have the time, I will add a small list of things you should definitely not miss while in my city.

I finished high school at St. Paul's School in 2010 and moved to IIT Roorkee in Uttarakhand to study engineering. 

I love reading poetry, mostly Urdu. Faiz Ahmed Faiz is my favourite poet. Unrelated, but my parents took my name (Yawar) from a favourite Faiz poem of theirs. 

When I am not in the lab, I am wasting my time buying single board computers I don't need, and finding uses for the ones I already own. Addressable LED strips are my favourite art media these days.
